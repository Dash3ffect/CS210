# CS210

Project Summary
This project was developed to address the Corner Grocer's need to analyze and understand the frequency of items purchased throughout the day. The main problem it solves is providing the grocer with insights into which items are most frequently purchased, allowing them to optimize their store layout accordingly. The program reads an input file containing a list of items purchased in chronological order, processes the data to count the frequency of each item, and presents the information through various user options, including a lookup feature, a frequency list, and a histogram.

What Went Well
One of the aspects I did particularly well in this project was the implementation of a class-based design that encapsulates the core functionality of item tracking. By using a map to store item frequencies, the program is both efficient and scalable, capable of handling large datasets with ease. Additionally, the user interface is intuitive, with a menu system that allows users to interact with the program seamlessly.

Areas for Enhancement
While the code is functional, there are areas where it could be enhanced. For instance, implementing input validation would make the program more secure and user-friendly, ensuring that users cannot accidentally enter invalid data that could cause the program to crash. Additionally, optimizing the file I/O operations could improve the programâ€™s performance, especially when dealing with very large input files. Refactoring the code to include more modular functions could also enhance readability and maintainability.

Challenges and Overcoming Them
The most challenging part of the code was writing the logic for the histogram generation, particularly ensuring that the output was both accurate and visually clear. To overcome this challenge, I relied on debugging tools and carefully stepped through the code to verify that each part was functioning as expected. I also consulted online resources and programming communities for best practices in handling text-based graphics in C++. Adding these tools and communities to my support network has strengthened my problem-solving skills.

Transferable Skills
The skills I developed in this project are highly transferable to other coursework and projects. For example, the experience with class-based design and encapsulation will be valuable in any object-oriented programming project. The use of maps to efficiently manage key-value pairs is another skill that will be applicable in a wide range of programming scenarios. Additionally, the practice of writing clean, well-documented code will benefit me in all future programming endeavors.

Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
To ensure that this program is maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I followed industry-standard best practices, such as using clear and descriptive variable names, adding in-line comments to explain the purpose of each section of code, and structuring the code in a logical manner. The class design allows for easy extension if additional features are needed in the future. For example, if the Corner Grocer wanted to add more complex analytics, such as tracking item sales over multiple days, the program could be adapted with minimal changes to the existing codebase.
